[Assignment 2 on GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/Z2sWwnXF) 

## Objective
Demonstrate your understanding of git, GitHub, Markdown, and basic Python environment management by completing the following tasks


1. `git`
	- [x] Clone your forked repository to your local machine
	- [x] Create and switch to a new branch
	- [x] Create a `readme.md` file in the new branch
	- [x] Add a copy of your python file from assignment 1 to the repo
	- [x] Stage and commit the files with a commit message
	- [x] Merge your new branch back with the `main` branch
	- [x] Push your changes to GitHub
2. Markdown
	- [x] Fill in your `readme.md` with the requested information from assignment 1
	- [x] Use formatting to separate sections using `# Header`'s
	- [x] Add a link to the official Python website (https://www.python.org)
3. Python environments & packages
	- [x] Create a virtual environment
	- [x] Activate the virtual environment
	- [x] Add the directory of the virtual environment to `.gitignore` (commit to repo)
	- [x] Use `pip install` or `python -m pip install` to install a package (okay to use the example from lecture)
	- [x] Take a screenshot of the installation
	- Add the screenshot to your assignment repository
4. Markdown
	- Add the screenshot image to your readme.md
	- Add a meme you like from the internet to readme.md
	- Commit and push changes back to GitHub
5. Check your work on GitHub, you should now have:
	- A single branch, `main`
	- Python file from assignment 1
	- `.gitignore` with at least one entry for the virtual environment folder
	- `readme.md` with assignment 1 content, plus images
