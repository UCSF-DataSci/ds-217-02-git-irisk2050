## q04 python script
 
Write a Python script to solve the following: If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get (3, 5, 6, 9). The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

```
target_num = 100 # we want multiples of 3 and 5 up until this number
 
mult_sum = sum(i for i in range(target_num) if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0)
 
print(f"Sum of multiples of 3 and 5 under below 100: {mult_sum}")
```
